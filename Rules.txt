;each clue split
;a is not b -> (a b nil)
;a is b -> (a b t)
;For multiple of the same facts, split it (ex: a and b are not c -> (a c nil), (b c nil))
;Neither a nor b has/is c -> (a c nil), (b c nil), (a b nil)
;a does/is not either b or c -> (a b nil), (a c nil)
;the n things are: a b c d...n -> (a b nil) (a c nil) (a d nil) ... (a n nil) (b c nil) (b d nil) ... (b n nil) (c d nil) ... etc.
;a is either b or c -> (b c nil) (a (b c) t) Note: (b c nil) can be removed if they are same type (ex: Nick has a dog or cat)
;a is either b or c -> (a x nil) where x is in the same list as b and c, but is not b and c
;of a and b, one was c and the other was d -> (a b nil) (c d nil) (a (c d)) (b (c d))
;a's b-type (ex: Whitehall's infield position) -> (a b nil)
;for words that encompass multiple things, break them out -> a is an outfielder -> a is either center or right -> use corresponding rule
;-> a is not an outfielder -> (a center nil) (b right nil)
'(
	;first clue: Neither Browning nor the two outfielders have a coin as a lucky charm
	;extended version of - Neither a nor b has/is c -> (a c nil), (b c nil), (a b nil)

	;uses both of these:
	;of a and b, one was c and the other was d -> (a b nil) (c d nil) (a (c d)) (b (c d))
	;the n things are: a b c d...n -> (a b nil) (a c nil) (a d nil) ... (a n nil) (b c nil) (b d nil) ... (b n nil) (c d nil) ... etc.
	(Greenfield (Center Right) t)
