# Logic-Puzzle-Solver

Two things we need to worry about when solving:

1. If there are n-1 false for a grid, the remaining one is true. In addition, if one is true, the remaining n-1 are false

2. If a and b is false, and a and c is true, then b and c is false

Luckily, everything will be an "is a" relationship - no comparisons
